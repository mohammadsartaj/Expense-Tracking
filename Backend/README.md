# ðŸš€ HisaabKitab Backend

The backend of **HisaabKitab** is the server-side engine that powers the app's functionalities. It is built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, and it handles RESTful APIs for user authentication, expense management, group transactions, and notifications. ðŸ”§

---

## **ðŸ“¦ Project Details**

### **Key Technologies**
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store user data, transactions, and group information.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests (frontend-backend communication).
- **CORS**: Middleware for enabling cross-origin requests between the client and server.
- **Nodemon**: A development utility that automatically restarts the server on file changes.

## **ðŸ”§ Setup and Installation**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure the following are installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: Version `16.x` or later
- **npm**: Version `7.x` or later
- **MongoDB**: Installed locally or available via a cloud provider like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### **2. Clone the Repository**
Clone the project and navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HisaabKitab.git
cd HisaabKitab/backend
```
**3. Install Dependencies**
Install all required dependencies:
```
npm install
This will install the following:
```
**Dependencies:**
```
axios: For handling HTTP requests.
bcryptjs: For securely hashing passwords.
cors: Middleware for enabling cross-origin requests.
dotenv: For managing environment variables.
express: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
jsonwebtoken: For secure user authentication with tokens.
mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB.
nodemailer: For sending transactional emails.
passport and passport-local: For handling authentication.
Dev Dependencies:
nodemon: For automatic server restarts during development.
```
**4. Set Up MongoDB**
Install MongoDB Locally:
Download MongoDB and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Start the MongoDB service:
```
mongod
Alternatively, you can use MongoDB Atlas to set up a cloud-based MongoDB instance.
```
Create a .env File: In the backend/ directory, create a .env file with the following keys:
**.env :**
```
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
EMAIL_SERVICE=your-email-service
EMAIL_USER=your-email-address
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
Replace your-mongodb-connection-uri with your local or cloud MongoDB connection string.
```

**5. Start the Backend Server**
Run the backend in development mode:
```
npm run dev
The server will start on http://localhost:5000 by default.
```


ðŸ›  Installing Key Technologies
1. MongoDB
Local Installation: Follow the official MongoDB installation guide.
Cloud Instance: Use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based MongoDB setup.
2. Nodemon
Nodemon automatically restarts the server whenever you make changes to the code. Install it globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g nodemon
3. Express.js
Express.js is installed via npm install. Itâ€™s included in the dependencies list.

To manually add Express.js to your project:

bash
Copy code
npm install express
4. Axios
Axios is used for HTTP requests and can be installed as follows:

bash
Copy code
npm install axios
5. CORS
CORS enables cross-origin requests between the client and the backend. Install it using:

bash
Copy code
npm install cors
**ðŸ“œ Scripts**
Here are the main scripts defined in the package.json:

**Development:**

```
npm run dev
```
Starts the backend server with Nodemon for automatic restarts during development.

**Test:**
```
npm test
```
Placeholder for running backend tests.

**ðŸ›  Tech Stack**
```
Node.js: Runtime environment for the server.
Express.js: Web framework for building APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
Axios: For making HTTP requests.
CORS: Middleware for handling cross-origin requests.
